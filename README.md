# PyMo

A framework in Mojo for AI/ML/DL applications and other domains.

## An extended framework for Mojo:
- The [MojoðŸ”¥](https://www.modular.com/mojo)programming language
- Mojo is built by Modular Inc. and the Mojo community.

## Overview
PyMo is a framework designed to leverage the capabilities of the Mojo programming language. The goal is to 
provide a seamless transition for Python developers into the realm of AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning 
(AI/ML/DL), and other domains - with the performance enhancements offered by Mojo. Since Mojo is designed as a 
systems programming language, its capabilities go beyond just AI/ML/DL. This extends to PyMo as well - it can
be leveraged in other programming languages and domains. See `docs` for more information.

**Current Status:** Work in Progress (WIP) - Proof of Concept

## Installation & Setup
To install and set up PyMo (on Linux), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:rcghpge/pymo.git
   cd pymo
   ```
2. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   magic run test
   ```
3. **Format Code**
   ```bash
   magic run format
   ```
4. **Initialize PyMo environment with Magic**
   ```bash
   magic shell
   ```
4. **Build & Ship Package(s) in Mojo (Optional)**
   ```bash
   magic run build
   ```
## Features
### Interoperability with Python:
PyMo showcases Mojo's potential to become a superset of Python, focusing on enhancing Python's AI/ML/DL capabilities
while providing a look into Mojo's domain-agnostic potential.

### Integration with Popular Libraries:
Here's how PyMo interacts with some well-known Python libraries:
- **scikit-learn:** For machine learning models.
- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy:** For numerical computing.
- **seaborn:** For statistical data visualization.
- **matplotlib:** For plotting.

I will be testing and benchmarking more libraries in leveraging Mojo. A reminder
that this is very much in a proof of concept stage project.

### Getting Started
Check out `examples/` folder for sample code demonstrating how to use PyMo with various AI/ML/DL tasks.

**MAX**
- check out [MAX](https://www.modular.com/max) an AI inference platform built by Modular
- PyMo can be leveraged in this framework.
